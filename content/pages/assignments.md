Papers
------

The writing assignments will introduce the tools used by professional music historians to communicate. In addition to some short one to two page assignments, there will be three papers, each 5 to 10 pages long.

The papers serve three main purposes: to stimulate research interests in music before 1625, to improve your academic writing in general, and to improve your writing about music in particular.
